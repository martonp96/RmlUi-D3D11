  This script is the "entrypoint" for PMM.

  This file should be COPIED and COMMITTED into the source tree of the project
  that wishes to use PMM. Do not use a file(DOWNLOAD), FetchContent(), or other
  pre-build script to download this file: It is intended to live in the source
  tree of its users and be very rarely be manually updated. This file is
  in-and-of-itself a FetchContent()-like script that will download and import
  the full PMM code.

  This script will not automatically upgrade the version of PMM that is imported
  unless you specifically request it. You can be assured that the PMM code being
  pulled is deterministic over time.

  The version of PMM that is bootstrapped by this script is controlled by a
  single CMake variable 'PMM_VERSION' that can be set before include()-ing this
  file. Additionally, the 'set(PMM_VERSION_INIT)' line above this readme can be
  modified to control the PMM version.

  HINT: You can run this script with CMake directly via 'cmake -P pmm.cmake' for
  additional command-line functionality. ]]

  The lines below set options that control how PMM is bootstrapped. These
  options can all be tweaked in one of two ways:

    - Change the default value of the option here in pmm.cmake in the associated
      call to pmm_option(). This is useful if you want to make a customized
      version of PMM and pmm.cmake to distribute and reuse between projects.

    - Set the associated variable before include()-ing this file. This is
      preferred for temporary changes, or for one-off projects that need custom
      values.

  The average user will not need to modify any variables except PMM_VERSION.

  Each option is documented below. Additional options and controls for PMM are
  documented in the README of the PMM repository.

    file.

    The initial value is controlled by 'PMM_VERSION_INIT', which is defined near
    the top of this file. Permanently updating the PMM version used by the
    project should be done by modifying 'PMM_VERSION_INIT' above directly rather
    than setting 'PMM_VERSION'
